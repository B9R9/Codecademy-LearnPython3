### Brute Force Password

***
## Introduction  
 Python exercise

***
## Objectives  
Create multiple chain of character that we can use to brute force Password

## Installation  
I made the choice to centralize all these projects in a single repo.
This does not allow you to download bruetForcePassword individually at the moment.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:B9R9/sandbox-Python3.git
$ cd ../path/to/the/folder/bruteForcePassword
```
***
## Compilation
In the folder, run:  
```
$>Python3 bruteForcePassword.py
```
