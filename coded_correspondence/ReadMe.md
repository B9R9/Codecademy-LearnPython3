### Coded Correspondance

***
## Introduction  
Exercise from Codecademy. 

***
## Objectives  
Code function that will encrypt and decrypt Ceasar Method or Vigenere

## Installation  
I made the choice to centralize all these projects in a single repo.
This does not allow you to download coded_correspondance individually at the moment.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:B9R9/sandbox-Python3.git
$ cd ../path/to/the/folder/coded_correspondance
```
***
## Compilation
In the folder run:  
```
jupyter notebook
```
if jupyter is not installed, you can use `conda install jupyter`.  
And to install miniconda, you can go `https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html`
